# 🚀 Project Overview

This system predicts future demand (sales/bookings/traffic) using:

* Statistical models
* Machine learning models
* Automated pipelines
* Experiment tracking
* Production APIs
* Containerized deployment

It mirrors how forecasting systems are built at companies like:

* Amazon
* Uber
* Swiggy
* Walmart
* Flipkart

The focus is on:

✔ Reproducibility
✔ Modularity
✔ Scalability
✔ Production readiness
✔ Clean architecture

---

# 🎯 Business Problem

Organizations need accurate demand forecasts to:

* Prevent stock-outs
* Reduce overstock
* Optimize pricing
* Improve supply chain planning
* Make data-driven decisions

This system delivers **multi-model forecasting + automated evaluation** to select the best model dynamically.

# ⚙️ Setup Instructions

## 1️⃣ Clone

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Time-Series-Forecasting
```

## 2️⃣ Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3️⃣ Run Training
